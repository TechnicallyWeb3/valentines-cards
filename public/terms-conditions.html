            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 14, 2024</div>
            
            <p>Welcome to Eternal Cards, an experimental project by members of the Technically Web3 (TW3) DAO ("we," "us," or "our"). Eternal Cards (the "Service") allows users to create and send NFT Valentines on the blockchain. By accessing or using our Service at https://eternal.cards (the "Site") or through any related interface, you ("User" or "you") agree to be bound by these Terms & Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please discontinue use immediately.</p>

            <h2>1. No Formal Jurisdiction or Business Entity</h2>
            <p>1.1 Community Project. Eternal Cards is developed independently by several members of the TW3 DAO. We are not a formal business entity and do not operate under a specific jurisdiction. These Terms outline the basic rules and disclaimers for using the Service in a decentralized, community-driven context.</p>
            <p>1.2 Local Law Compliance. You are responsible for complying with any applicable laws or regulations in your jurisdiction regarding blockchain or cryptocurrency usage, including age restrictions or other limitations that may apply.</p>

            <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
            <p>2.1 Facilitation of Blockchain Transactions. Eternal Cards facilitates the process of minting blockchain-based NFT Valentines. The Service interacts with the blockchain on your behalf, but we do not publish or control the data. You, as the user, initiate transactions and publish data onto the blockchain using your own self-custody wallet.</p>
            
            <p>2.2 Self-Custody Wallet Required. To use the Service, you must have a compatible self-custody cryptocurrency wallet. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet and private keys.</p>
            
            <p>2.3 Fees.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A base fee of 3 POL is charged to mint a card.</li>
                <li>An additional 15 POL is charged if you choose to include a custom message.</li>
                <li>Fees are subject to change at any time. We reserve the right to adjust pricing without prior notice.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>2.4 Open Source Software. Much of our code is open source. However, our logos, artwork, and certain other assets are protected by these Terms (see Section 7, "Intellectual Property").</p>

            <p>2.5 No Refunds. Once a transaction is sent to the blockchain, it is permanent. There are no refunds under any circumstance.</p>

            <p>2.6 Royalties and Proceeds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All proceeds from initial minting go directly to support the TW3 community.</li>
                <li>A 5% royalty is requested on secondary market sales of Eternal Cards NFTs.</li>
                <li>The royalty percentage is subject to change at any time without prior notice.</li>
                <li>We acknowledge that royalty enforcement varies by marketplace and cannot be guaranteed by smart contract.</li>
                <li>By using the Service, you agree to respect these royalty terms when trading Eternal Cards NFTs on secondary markets, where technically possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>3.1 Content Ownership & Liability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User-Generated Content. You are solely responsible for any content (including messages, data, or images) you decide to publish to the blockchain. Once published, it cannot be removed or altered.</li>
                <li>Third-Party Use. We are not liable for any actions or omissions by users or third parties on the blockchain.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>3.2 Prohibited Conduct. You agree not to use Eternal Cards to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread hateful, discriminatory, or inflammatory content.</li>
                <li>Plagiarize material or violate intellectual property rights.</li>
                <li>Submit boilerplate or spam-like messages.</li>
                <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations in your jurisdiction.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>3.3 Acknowledgment of Permanence. You understand that data written to a blockchain is immutable and public, and that associating yourself with other accounts could reveal information about your identity.</p>

            <p>3.4 Risk of Blockchain Usage. You acknowledge that using blockchain-based services carries inherent risks, including but not limited to software bugs, potential vulnerabilities, and market fluctuations in cryptocurrency. You agree to bear these risks and release Eternal Cards, TW3 DAO, and its contributors from liability.</p>

            <h2>4. No Publisher Liability</h2>
            <p>4.1 User-Controlled Transactions. Eternal Cards provides an interface that facilitates blockchain transactions. We do not publish or confirm transactions; you do, using your own wallet.</p>

            <p>4.2 Independence from Blockchain. We have no control over the blockchain or any nodes, miners, or validators. The blockchain operates independently, and any issues, errors, or unintended consequences of on-chain transactions are outside our control.</p>

            <p>4.3 Content Visibility & Moderation. While the blockchain data is immutable, we reserve the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blacklist or filter certain wallet addresses from using our interface if deemed harmful, spam, or in violation of these Terms.</li>
                <li>Refuse to display any content or messages in our UI that we consider to be hateful, inappropriate, or in breach of these Terms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>5.1 Our Logos and Artwork. Although we do not maintain formal trademarks, our logos, brand name, and certain artwork associated with Eternal Cards ("Eternal Cards IP") are protected by applicable copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not use, copy, modify, or distribute Eternal Cards IP without our explicit permission.</p>

            <p>5.2 Open Source Software and Artwork. Portions of Eternal Cards are open source, and we encourage contributions and reuse under the relevant open source licenses. However, we ask all users who reuse our open source software or artwork to credit both Eternal Cards and TW3.</p>

            <p>5.3 Third-Party Intellectual Property. You are responsible for ensuring that any content you submit (including text, images, or other works) does not violate any third-party intellectual property rights.</p>

            <h2>6. Disclaimers of Warranties</h2>
            <p>6.1 "As-Is" Basis. Eternal Cards and any related software, services, or materials are provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. We make no warranties or representations of any kind, express or implied.</p>

            <p>6.2 No Guarantees. We do not guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted, or secure access to the Service. You assume the entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of Eternal Cards.</p>

            <p>6.3 No Advice. Nothing in these Terms or on our Site should be considered financial, investment, or legal advice. Always do your own research and consult professionals as needed.</p>

            <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>7.1 No Liability for On-Chain Actions. We are not liable for any user-generated content or user actions on the blockchain. You assume full responsibility for your transactions.</p>

            <p>7.2 Exclusion of Damages. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we (including TW3 DAO contributors) will not be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special, or punitive damages arising from or related to your use of the Service.</p>

            <p>7.3 Release. You hereby release Eternal Cards, TW3 DAO, and its contributors from any and all claims, demands, and damages arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute between you and any other user or third party.</p>

            <h2>8. Termination & Blacklisting</h2>
            <p>8.1 No On-Chain Reversal. We cannot remove or reverse on-chain content once it is published. Transactions on the blockchain are final.</p>

            <p>8.2 Blacklisting from UI. We may, at our sole discretion, blacklist or filter any wallet address from our user interface if that address is used to violate these Terms or to engage in unlawful or harmful conduct.</p>

            <p>8.3 No Ongoing Obligation. We reserve the right to discontinue or modify the Service at any time without notice.</p>

            <h2>9. Privacy & Data Handling</h2>
            <p>9.1 User Data. Eternal Cards does not actively collect personal data beyond what is necessary for basic web analytics or user communication. By using a self-custody wallet, you interact with the blockchain directly; we do not store or control your private keys.</p>

            <p>9.2 On-Chain Data. Any data you publish to the blockchain becomes publicly accessible and cannot be deleted. This may include messages and links to other accounts or wallets, potentially exposing personal information if such details can be connected to your identity.</p>

            <p>9.3 Regulatory Compliance. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any data protection regulations in your jurisdiction, including but not limited to GDPR or other privacy laws.</p>

            <h2>10. Changes to the Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Changes will be effective upon posting to https://eternal.cards. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

            <h2>11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>11.1 No Formal Jurisdiction. Because Eternal Cards is a community-driven project without a formal legal entity, we do not designate a specific jurisdiction's laws to govern these Terms. You agree that any legal disputes or claims arising out of these Terms will be governed by principles of decentralized use, to the extent permissible by your local laws.</p>

            <p>11.2 Informal Resolution. In the event of any dispute, you agree to attempt informal resolution by contacting us through the TW3 community channels before pursuing formal legal action.</p>

            <h2>12. Additional Provisions</h2>
            <p>12.1 Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service and supersede any prior understandings or agreements.</p>
            
            <p>12.2 Severability. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, invalid, or illegal, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            
            <p>12.3 No Waiver. Any failure or delay by us in enforcing any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of that provision.</p>
            
            <p>12.4 Contact. For any questions about these Terms, please reach out to us through the official TW3 DAO communication channels, as listed on https://eternal.cards.</p>
